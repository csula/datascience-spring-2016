Students' feedback on what could've done better for this class:

1. Use only one languages as to Java and Python. (aka. focus only on Python)
2. Give more time on certain technology (under-grad wants more on Kibana while grad wants more on Python & Machine Learning)
3. Give overall architecture first
4. More guided project while still keeping the certain level of freedom as to complete freedom without guidelines
5. More take home quiz (or some certain way of make up after in class quiz)

Some crazy ideas but I like:

* Make project senior design project (so having more time to finish the project)
